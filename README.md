# Battle_over_FPGA

This repository is my quest to learn and practice VHDL language.

The platform used to work with VHDL is Vivado software designed with Xilinx. I installed Vivado based on [this tutorial](https://faradandish.com/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%8C-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%A8-%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%B1%DA%A9-%D9%86%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%88/).

The projects and exercises are based on the Coursera "Hardware Description Languages for FPGA Design" course. Here is the [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-hardware-description-languages).
