Here's three pictures of D flip-flop examples. For each we have a D input, a clock, and a reset as input, and a q as an output.

note: If we want to synchronize a path, we would take the combinatorial logic of that path, and we would add a clock and a flip-flop to the output of it, and now our logic has become synchronized.
